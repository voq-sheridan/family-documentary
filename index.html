                    In 1998, our parents made the courageous decision to leave everything familiar behind. 
                    With two young children and dreams of a better future, they embarked on a journey 
                    across continents, carrying nothing but hope and determination.

                    The first winter was the hardest. The snow, the cold, the unfamiliar faces. 
                    But slowly, this foreign land began to feel like home. Small victories became 
                    celebrations — the first job, the first friend, the first "thank you" in perfect English.

                    I was seven when we arrived. Old enough to remember the country we left, 
                    young enough to adapt. The playground was where I learned English, 
                    where accents faded and friendships formed over games of hockey on frozen ponds.

                    At home, we spoke our mother tongue. At school, I was just another Canadian kid. 
                    This duality became my strength — bridging cultures, carrying two identities 
                    with equal pride. I learned that home isn't just a place; it's wherever your people are.

                    I was born just two years after we arrived. Canada is all I've ever known, 
                    yet I grew up surrounded by stories of another place. My parents' homeland 
                    lives in our traditions, our food, the language we speak at dinner tables.

                    embracing where you are. Identity isn't about choosing one over the other — 
                    it's about celebrating both.

                    This is our story — one family among millions who have woven their threads
